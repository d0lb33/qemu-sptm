/*
 * darwin-dcp: Display Coprocessor personality on top of darwin-asc
 *
 * On A14+/M1+ the display is driven entirely by the DCP firmware; the AP's
 * AppleDCP / IOMobileFramebuffer / AppleCLCD2 stack talks to it over RTKit
 * endpoints. This file is the DCP-shaped glue: it decides which endpoints
 * exist and which protocol runs on each, and owns nothing else.
 *
 * Endpoint map (docs/re/dcp-bringup.md, from the iOS 27 kernelcache's
 * IOKitPersonalities; confirmed live by the RTKit endpoint-start trace):
 *
 *   0x20 .. 0x2a   DCPEndpoint1..11   AppleDCPEndpointV2 -- AFK ring
 *                                     transport with EPIC framing on top.
 *                                     Handled here by darwin_afk.c.
 *   0x37           DCPEndpoint24      AppleDCPLinkServiceSoC -- IOMFB, a
 *                                     different RPC framing that rides
 *                                     directly on RTKit, *not* AFK. Not
 *                                     advertised yet, so XNU never starts it.
 *
 * What works today: the RTKit handshake (darwin_asc.c), the AFK transport
 * handshake for every 0x20..0x2a endpoint (darwin_afk.c), and one EPIC
 * REPORT/PUBLISH per endpoint announcing a service by name (darwin_epic.c),
 * which is what XNU's sub-driver personalities match on -- every one of them
 * is `IOProviderClass = AFKEndpointInterface` plus
 * `IOPropertyMatch = { EPICName: ... }` in the kernelcache's
 * __PRELINK_INFO. What does not: any command/response traffic *after* a
 * driver binds. Commands the AP sends us are decoded and logged, and
 * deliberately not answered -- see dcp_afk_recv().
 *
 * WHAT TO ANNOUNCE is policy, and it lives here rather than in darwin_epic.c.
 * The service list below is the "confirmed both sides" table from
 * docs/re/dcp-firmware-services.md: each name appears both as an `-epic`
 * string in the real t8140 DCP firmware and as an `EPICName` IOPropertyMatch
 * in this kernelcache, so XNU really will try to bind the named class.
 *
 * Which endpoint carries which service is *not* known for t8140 -- the
 * endpoint-to-service correlation in docs/re/afk-epic-references.md sec. 4 is
 * M1-era and explicitly unconfirmed. It should not matter: matching keys on
 * the announced properties, not on the endpoint number. The default is
 * therefore one service on one endpoint, overridable without a rebuild:
 *
 *   DARWIN_DCP_EPIC=off                   announce nothing (pre-EPIC behaviour)
 *   DARWIN_DCP_EPIC=all                   announce every service in dcp_services[]
 *   DARWIN_DCP_EPIC=dcpav-device-epic     announce just that one
 *   DARWIN_DCP_EPIC_EP=0x22               ...on this endpoint (default 0x20)
 *   DARWIN_DCP_EPIC_OPTIONS=0             packet header options byte
 *
 * Tracing: DARWIN_ASC_DEBUG=1 for the mailbox, DARWIN_AFK_DEBUG=1 for the
 * ring transport, DARWIN_DART_DEBUG=1 for the IOMMU underneath it. The
 * announce itself always logs one line per service (prefix "dcp:", which is
 * what tools/probe.sh filters device-model traces on).
