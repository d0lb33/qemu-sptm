/*
 * darwin-iomfb: the DCP "link" protocol on endpoint 0x37, firmware side.
 *
 * Endpoint 0x37 is DCPEndpoint24 / AppleDCPLinkServiceSoC, the endpoint the
 * *framebuffer* rides on. It is NOT AFK and NOT EPIC: the 64-bit RTKit
 * mailbox word is itself the message, with a structured 16-bit header in the
 * low bits and a class-dependent payload above it.
 *
 * SOURCE for everything below: iOS 27.0 beta (24A5430a), iPhone17,3
 * (t8140/H17P), kernelcache firmware/bootkc, fileset entry
 * com.apple.iokit.IOMobileGraphicsFamily-DCP. The kext is stripped (nsyms=0),
 * so functions are named by string cross-reference. Unslid VAs; the panic
 * addresses the guest prints are these + 0x20000000. The long-form write-up
 * with the reasoning is docs/re/iomfb-link.md.
 *
 *   link_send_message      fcn.fffffff00a0cecd0
 *   link_handle_message    fcn.fffffff00a0cfac0   (the AP's receive dispatcher)
 *   link_init_ack step     fcn.fffffff00a0ce0f0
 *   rpc_caller_gated       fcn.fffffff00a0ce46c   (aka link_shared_alloc)

 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- header --
 *
 * link_send_message builds, and link_handle_message dispatches on, exactly
 * these fields. The 48-bit boundary is the literal operand of
 * `and x8, x2, 0xffffffffffff0000` at 0xa0ced14 -- not an inference.
 *
 *   [1:0]    class    `and w26, w28, 3`      @ 0xa0cfb04
 *   [5:2]    unused   (zero in every message seen, read by nobody)
 *   [7:6]    subkind  `ubfx w0, w28, 6, 2`   @ 0xa0cfb14
 *   [8]      ack bit  `bfi ..., 8, 1`        @ 0xa0ced10, keyed on @ 0xa0cfc48
 *   [9]      flag     passed through by the sender (`x2 & 0x2ff` keeps it)
 *   [15:10]  6-bit tag `(*ctx & 0x3f) << 10` @ 0xa0ced00, extracted @ 0xa0cfc4c
 *   [63:16]  payload, meaning depends on class
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------- the flow --
 *
 * 1. AP -> IOP, class 0 / subkind 1: "here is my shared heap".
 *    Built at 0xa0ce074 as `0x40 | (dva << 16)`; observed
 *    0x0100000000000040, i.e. DVA 0x10000000000. It is SEND-ONLY: echoing it
 *    back makes the AP take link_handle_message's own class-0/subkind-1
 *    branch (0xa0d0008), which unconditionally logs
 *    "link_init_ack_callback failed with 0x6" and returns kIOReturnNoMemory,
 *    panicking at AppleDCPLinkService.cpp:882. Verified live.
 *
 * 2. IOP -> AP, class 1: the init ack. link_handle_message's class-1 branch
 *    (0xa0cfb5c) computes
 *      local  = crc32(0, (uint8_t*)0xfffffff00b880c70, 4)   @ 0xa0cfb60-b6c
 *    and compares it 32-bit against
 *      remote = (msg >> 16) & 0xffffffff                    @ 0xa0cfb9c-ba0
 *    Those four bytes of the kext's own __DATA are `d3 00 00 00` (bootkc file
 *    offset 0x487cc70), and zlib.crc32(b"\xd3\0\0\0") == 0x15a5c96b, which is
 *    exactly the `local=` the guest printed when we got this wrong. So the
 *    constant is reproduced from first principles rather than copied out of a
 *    panic -- but it is specific to THIS kernelcache; recompute it from those
 *    bytes for a different build. Bits[63:48] are a phase/count the AP stores
 *    as max(phase, 4) at chan+0x48 (0xa0cfbe4-0xa0cfc00), so 0 is safe.
 *
 * 3. AP -> IOP, class 2 / subkind 0: "there is an RPC request in the heap".
 *    Built by rpc_caller_gated at 0xa0ce65c-0xa0ce688:
 *        x24 = offset; bfi w24, w25, 16, 16     ; w25 = total size
 *        x25 = 2; bfi x25, x23, 9, 1            ; class 2, bit 9 = a caller flag
 *        x2  = x25 | (x24 << 16)
 *    i.e. bits[31:16] = byte offset into the heap, bits[47:32] = total size.
 *    The request itself is written into the heap at that offset by
 *    0xa0ce608-0xa0ce654:
 *        +0x00  u32  name    a FourCC, printed big-endian at 0xa0ce4a8-4c4
 *        +0x04  u32  in_len
 *        +0x08  u32  out_len
 *        +0x0c  u8   in[in_len]
 *        +0x0c+in_len  u8 out[out_len]   <- the IOP fills this in
 *    and total size == 0xc + in_len + out_len (`add w11,w26,0xc;
 *    adds w25,w22,w11` @ 0xa0ce4d8-4dc). The caller then blocks in
 *    link_cond_wait_priv.
 *
 * 4. IOP -> AP, class 2 / subkind 1: the completion. The waiter checks
 *        (reply_header & 0xc3) == 0x42                      @ 0xa0ce750-75c
 *    -- 0xc3 masks class and subkind, 0x42 is class 2 + subkind 1 -- and then
 *        status = (u32)(reply >> 16); if (status) fail       @ 0xa0ce78c-790
 *        memcpy(caller_out, heap + offset + 0xc + in_len, out_len)  @ 0xa0ce7c8-7dc
 *    The reply is routed back to the right caller by a lookup keyed on
 *    (ack_bit << 32) | tag (0xa0cfc44-4c), so the reply must carry the
 *    request's own tag and ack bit. Class 2 + subkind 1 is also the one
 *    combination link_send_message REQUIREs you not to send directly
 *    (0xa0ced2c-38) -- it is reply-only, which is a second confirmation that
 *    this is the completion shape.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------- 5. the callee direction (D) --
 *
 * The same class-2 layer runs the other way: the firmware originates a
 * request and the AP answers it. That is the "D-series", and it is how the
 * DCP drives display bring-up past the point our AP-only model reaches.
 * Derived in full in docs/re/iomfb-dseries.md; the parts the code below
 * depends on:
 *
 *  - Correlation. link_handle_message builds a key (ack << 32) | tag from
 *    every class-2 message (0xa0cfc44-0xa0cfc4c) and hands it to the lambda
 *    at 0xa0d0318, which picks one of TWO four-entry slot arrays --
 *    chan+0x78 when the ack bit equals chan[0x70], chan+0x218 when it does
 *    not (0xa0d0328-0xa0d0334) -- and indexes it by the tag, which must be
 *    < 4 (0xa0d033c, else a REQUIRE-fail). So the "6-bit tag" is really a
 *    2-bit slot index per direction.
 *
 *  - Which ack bit. link_state_init stores zero to chan[0x70]
 *    (`str wzr, [x19, #0x260]` at 0xa0cf5e8, and chan == L+0x1f0), and
 *    link_send_message sources bit 8 from that same byte when no ctx is
 *    passed -- which is exactly why the AP's own announce and its own RPC
 *    requests have bit 8 clear. An inbound request must therefore set
 *    **bit 8**, or it lands in the AP's own outgoing slot array.
 *
 *    That direction bit remains set for AP calls nested inside a D-series
 *    handler.  The iOS 27 D120 handler at 0xfffffff00919b338 enters its boot
 *    continuation at 0xfffffff009188040; that continuation's first nested
 *    A389 wrapper is 0xfffffff00917f11c (FourCC build at 0x917f124), and its
 *    live messages are class 2 / subkind 0 / ack 1.  This is also the stack
 *    rule used by the independent Asahi implementations: Linux
 *    drivers/gpu/drm/apple/iomfb.c:dcp_call_context() selects callback context
 *    when channel depth is nonzero, and m1n1 fw/dcp/manager.py:DCPManager
 *    selects CallContext.CB while in_callback.  Therefore ack 1 distinguishes
 *    callback context, not "not an AP request".
 *
 *  - Where the bytes go. link_state_init allocates one 0x80000 heap
 *    (0xa0cf5cc) and carves it into eight fixed 32 KB windows
 *    (0xa0cf654-0xa0cf6e0). The AP's own request for tag t is at
 *    heap + t*0x8000 + offset (slot+8); an inbound request for tag t is at
 *    heap + 0x40000 + t*0x8000 + offset (slot+0x18), which is the pointer
 *    rpc_callee_gated actually dereferences (0xa0cf0d0). The offset field is
 *    relative to that window, not to the heap.
 *
 *  - What the AP checks (rpc_callee_gated, fcn.fffffff00a0cf020): class 2,
 *    subkind != 1, size >= 0xc, size == 0xc + in_len + out_len, and the
 *    whole thing inside the 32 KB window. Then it calls
 *      handler(chan, slot, in, in_len, out, out_len)      @ 0xa0cf1e8-1fc
 *    found by a virtual link_rpc_lookup at vtable+0x540 of chan[0x68].
 *
 *  - The completion it sends back (0xa0cf298-0xa0cf2b4):
 *      msg = (our_header & 0xff3e) | 0x40 | (our bits[63:48] << 48)
 *    i.e. class 2 subkind 1, our tag and our ack bit, and **status 0 in
 *    bits[47:16]** on success. The output it wrote is at
 *    window + offset + 0xc + in_len.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------- what is stubbed --
 *
 * The RPC methods themselves, in both directions.
 *
 * Inbound (A-series): we log every FourCC and hexdump its input, and answer
 * with status 0 and a zeroed output buffer. That is a deliberate, documented
 * hole: no method's semantics have been derived from this firmware, so
 * returning "success, all zeroes" is the only answer that does not invent
 * behaviour. Where it is wrong the AP will say so by name, which is how the
 * next method gets modelled.
 *
 * Outbound (D-series): the transport is modelled, the *policy* is not. This
 * file has no opinion about which callback a real DCP would send, or when.
 * DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB_CB is an experiment harness that issues a scripted list so
 * a boot can answer "does the AP accept this name, and what does it do next";
 * with the variable unset nothing is ever sent. docs/re/iomfb-dseries.md has
 * the 139 names link_rpc_lookup accepts and the buffer sizes each handler
 * demands, which is what a script is written from.
 *
 * Class 3 is never sent by either side here and is not modelled. Class 2 /
 * subkind 0 messages with a heap we have not been told about are logged and
 * dropped rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Tracing and knobs: DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB selects the level (see
 * darwin_iomfb.h); DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB_DEBUG=1 adds a hexdump of every RPC
 * request and reply body. DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB_RPC_TRACE=1 is the narrower
 * reverse-engineering trace: every AP-originated call gets one context line
 * with its slot, heap/request DVAs and lengths, while the first occurrence of
 * each exact request body gets a bounded sparse input dump. This is intended
 * to identify this build's real swap-submit method and its surf_iova field
 * without assuming that Mac-era method IDs or layouts survived on iOS.
 * DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB_OUT='A401=01,...' substitutes canned output bytes for one
 * FourCC so a probe can test a hypothesis without a rebuild. Level 4 is that
 * same mechanism with the answers a measurement has already justified (see
 * iomfb_level4[]).
 * DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB_CB='D000,@A385,D003:00000000:14' scripts outbound
 * callbacks; an @NAME item is a barrier that waits for that later AP RPC
 * before the following callback is sent. DARWIN_DCP_IOMFB_CB_AFTER names
 * what starts the script. Every line is prefixed "iomfb:", which
 * tools/probe.sh filters on.
